# DDS
The algorithm DDS is the abbreviation of Distance Dynamic Synchronization. DDS is used to detect non-overlapping community sturcture in the network. A network is saved in the file with a .txt suffix. Each line consisting of two numbers in the file is an edge of the network. Each number in the file is the id of a vertex.
